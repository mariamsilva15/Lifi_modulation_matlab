================================================================================
WHAT?

Optilux is an open-source collection of algorithms to design, simulate, and 
analyze optical communication systems. Optilux is implemented as a Matlab/Octave 
toolbox and efficiently exploits the most advanced tools for system analysis.

Optilux is released under the GNU General public license, version 3.

================================================================================
INSTALLATION

The installation is simple: copy the directory where you like, and add it to 
the Matlab/Octave path, for instance by entering the following statement 
under the Matlab/Octave command window (once per session):

addpath path_of_optilux

where path_of_optilux must be substituted with the true path. For old hardware,
the speed of the code can be increased by compiling the *.c files within the 
optilux directory using the MEX interface.	
The compilation can be done by running:

mex filename.c

NOTE: The compilation of .c files can fail because Matlab is unable to find
the correct c++-standard-library. In this case, edit your mexopts.sh file
(you can create it in ~/.matlabxx/mexopts.sh by running mex -setup in Matlab)
and replace the line:

CLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm -lstdc++"

by, (e.g. if you have Matlab in /opt)

CLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm /opt/matlab/sys/os/glnx86/libstdc++.so.5"

Another solution under Debian-based Linux systems is to run the following: 

apt-get install build-essential 

This package contains an informational list of packages which are considered 
essential for building Debian packages.

USAGE

Each function has its detailed help. Start by running the examples in the
subdirectory Examples/.


Have fun
